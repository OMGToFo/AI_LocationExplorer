# AI Location Explorer

The idea here was to try out if ut's is possible to generate an AI Location Guide that gives you ideas and inspiration for short trips, exkursions or walks for example if you are in a new place and have a few hours to off. It shows the suggested route on a map based on the POI and the distance of your choice


Sometimes, i think in bigger cities and famous places, the AI finds some good stuff, but in othe rcases it was not so helpful or even suggested POIs that don't excist in reality.
You have to enter your own ChatgPT / OpenAI key to use the app.

The app is running here:
